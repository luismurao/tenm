\title{ellipsoid_selection: Performs variable selection for ellipsoid models}
\usage{
ellipsoid_selection(
  env_train,
  env_test = NULL,
  env_vars,
  nvarstest,
  level = 0.95,
  mve = TRUE,
  env_bg = NULL,
  omr_criteria,
  parallel = F,
  ncores = NULL,
  comp_each = 100,
  proc = FALSE,
  proc_iter = 100,
  rseed = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{env_train}{A data frame with the environmental training data.}

\item{env_test}{A data frame with the environmental testing data. The default
is NULL if given the selection process will show the p-value of a binomial
test.}

\item{env_vars}{A vector with the names of environmental variables to be
used in the selection process.}

\item{nvarstest}{A vector indicating the number of variables to fit the
ellipsoids during model selection. It is allowed to test models with a
different number of variables (i.e. nvarstest=c(3,6)).}

\item{level}{Proportion of points to be included in the ellipsoids. This
parameter is equivalent to the error (E) proposed by Peterson et al. (2008).}

\item{mve}{A logical value. If TRUE a minimum volume ellipsoid will be
computed using the function \code{\link[MASS]{cov.rob}} of the \pkg{MASS}
package. If False the covariance matrix of the input data will be used.}

\item{env_bg}{Environmental data to compute the approximated prevalence of
the model. The data should be a sample of the environmental layers of the
calibration area.}

\item{omr_criteria}{Omission rate criteria. Value of the omission rate
allowed for the selection process. Default NULL see details.}

\item{parallel}{The computations will be run in parallel. Default FALSE}

\item{ncores}{The number of cores that will be used for the parallel process.
By default tenm will use the total number of available cores less one.}

\item{comp_each}{Number of models to run in each job in the parallel
computation. Default 100}

\item{proc}{Logical if TRUE a partial roc test will be run.}

\item{proc_iter}{Numeric. The total number of iterations for the partial ROC
bootstrap.}

\item{rseed}{Logical. Whether or not to set a random seed for partial roc
bootstrap. Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with 5 columns: i) "fitted_vars" the names of variables
that were fitted; ii) "om_rate" omission rates of the model; iii)
"bg_prevalence" approximated prevalence of the model see details section;
iv) The rank value of importance in model selection by omission rate; v)
The rank value by prevalence after if the value of omr_criteria is passed.
}
\description{
Performs variable selection for ellipsoid models according to
omission rates in the environmental space.
}
\details{
Model selection occurs in environmental space (E-space). For each
variable combination the omission rate (omr) in E-space is computed using the
function \code{\link[tenm]{inEllipsoid}}. The results will be ordered by omr
and if the user-specified the environmental background "env_bg" an
estimated prevalence will be computed and the results will be ordered also
by "bg_prevalence". The number of variables to construct candidate models
can be specified by the user in the parameter "nvarstest". Model selection
will be run in parallel if the user-specified more than one set of
combinations and the total number of models to be tested is greater than 500.
If given"omr_criteria" and "bg_prevalence", the results will be shown
pondering those models that met the "omr_criteria" by the value of
"bg_prevalence".
