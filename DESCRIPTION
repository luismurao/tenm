Description: Implements methods and functions to calibrate 
  time-specific niche models (multi-temporal calibration), letting users 
  execute a strict calibration and selection process of niche models based 
  on ellipsoids, as well as functions to project the potential distribution in 
  the present and in global change  scenarios.The 'tenm' package has functions
  to recover information that may be lost or overlooked while applying a data 
  curation protocol. This curation involves preserving occurrences that may 
  appear spatially redundant (occurring in the same pixel) but originate from 
  different time periods. A novel aspect of this package is that it might 
  reconstruct the fundamental niche more accurately than mono-calibrated 
  approaches. The theoretical background of the package can be found in 
  Peterson et al. (2011)<doi:10.5860/CHOICE.49-6266>.
