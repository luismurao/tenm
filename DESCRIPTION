Description: A package to model the ecological niche using a time-specific 
  approach. A set of tools made to generate ecological niche models 
  with a time-calibrated focus. The framework allows users to calibrate 
  ecological niche models with high temporal resolution environmental layers. 
  The main objective of this package is to recover information that is 
  lost or at least neglected while applying a data curation protocol. 
  The curation that consists in conservating occurrences that might seen 
  redundant spatially (occur in the same pixel) but are from different periods. 
  The novelty in this package is that it might reconstruct the fundamental niche
  more accurately. The theoretical background of the package can be found 
  in Peterson et al. (2011) \doi{10.5860/CHOICE.49-6266}.
